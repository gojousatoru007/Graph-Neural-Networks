# Node Representations with DeepWalk

**Deep Walk** introduces important concepts such as embeddings that are at the code of GNNs. Unlike traditional neural networks, the goal of this architecture is to produce **representations** that are then fed to other models, which perfrom downstream tasks (for example, node classification).
